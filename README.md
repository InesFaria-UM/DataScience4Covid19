# DataScience4Covid19
This project was proposed under the curricular unit of Intelligent Systems For Bioinformatics. The objective of this practical work, in this academic year, will be to address a theme that is relevant within the current pandemic situation, and that can be addressed using the methods studied in class in the scope of data sciences, including the statistical data analysis, data mining, machine learning and deep learning.

## Elements of the Group:
Ana Barbosa pg40951, Maria Fernanda Vieira pg40963, Maria InÃªs Faria pg40964, Miguel Pacheco pg28837

## Generic Topic: 
Clinical Data / Images

## Questions to resolve / objectives of the data analysis to be carried out: 
Classification of radiology images of covid patients vs other lung diseases

## Data / Data sources to consider:
In this work we will use the data from Kaggle (COVID-19 X-Ray Dataset) mainly the X-ray images of COVID-19 patients and patients with bacterial / viral pneumonia. If it turns out to be interesting for the study, we will proceed with the analysis of data from normal people, in other words, without any type of associated lung disease. 

## Motivation: 
In this difficult phase that we are all going through, we believe that science has an increasingly important role in our society. So, we chose this topic because we believe that the development of deep learning methods, able to classify radiology images of covid patients or other lung diseases, would facilitate the work of doctors.
